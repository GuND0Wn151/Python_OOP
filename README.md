# Python_OOP
Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

With this learning path you’ll get a solid grasp of the fundamentals of OOP in Python and how you can use this programming paradigm to make your programs easier to write and maintain.
#OOP in Python
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.

One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

An object has two characteristics:

attributes
behavior
Let's take an example:

A parrot is can be an object,as it has the following properties

name, age, color as attributes.
singing, dancing as behavior.



The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
