# Python_OOP
Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

With this learning path youâ€™ll get a solid grasp of the fundamentals of OOP in Python and how you can use this programming paradigm to make your programs easier to write and maintain.
# # OOP in Python
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.

One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

An object has two characteristics:

* Attributes
* Behavior
Let's take an example:

A parrot is can be an object,as it has the following properties

* name, age, color as attributes.
* singing, dancing as behavior.



The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
